# Car-Price-Predictor_ML-Project

Car Price Prediction
This project is a machine learning application that predicts the price of cars based on various features. It utilizes a trained machine learning model to make accurate predictions.

Technologies Used
Python: Used for building the machine learning model and backend server.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Used for creating the user interface.
Bootstrap: Used for styling the frontend components.
Flask: Used as the web framework for serving the application.
How It Works
The project follows these steps to predict car prices:

Data Collection: Data on various cars including their features like company, model, year, kilometers driven, and fuel type are collected.
Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for training.
Model Training: A machine learning model is trained on the preprocessed data using the Python programming language.
Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Users can input the details of a car they want to predict the price for.
Prediction: When the user submits the car details, the web interface sends a request to the Flask server, which uses the trained model to predict the price of the car.
Display Prediction: The predicted price is then displayed to the user on the web interface.
How to Use
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Flask server by executing python application.py.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
Input the details of the car you want to predict the price for and click on the "Predict Price" button.
